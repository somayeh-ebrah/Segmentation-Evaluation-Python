    "# Evaluation of Segmentation Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating segmentation algorithms is most often done using reference data to which you compare your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I have written a code for evaluating the segmentation results obtained by the proposed algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I illustrate the use of the following evaluation criteria:\n",
    " \n",
    "  - Overlap measures:\n",
    "  - Jaccard and Dice coefficients\n",
    "  - false negative and false positive errors\n",
    "  - Surface distance measures:\n",
    "  - Hausdorff distance (symmetric)\n",
    "  - mean, median, max and standard deviation between surfaces\n",
    "  - Volume measures:\n",
    "  - volume similarity  \n",
    "    \n",
    "The relevant criteria are task dependent, so you need to ask yourself whether you are interested in detecting spurious errors or not \n",
    "(mean or max surface distance), whether over/under segmentation should be differentiated (volume similarity and Dice or just Dice), \n",
    "and what is the ratio between acceptable errors and the size of the segmented object (Dice coefficient may be too sensitive to small \n",
    "errors when the segmented object is small and not sensitive enough to large errors when the segmented object is large).\n"
