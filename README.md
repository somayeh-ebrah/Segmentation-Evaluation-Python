# Segmentation-Evaluation-Python

In this repository, I have written a python code for evaluating the segmentation results obtained by the proposed algorithm. The code lists downs the folder of subjects' list (a folder including the segmentation results) an a folder of subjects including the reference segmentation. Then reads the files one by one and calculate the evaluation metrics. The final results are saved into a csv file for further statistical analysis. 

# Evaluation metrics:
- Jaccard	index
- Dice coefficient 
- Volume Similarity	
- False Negative 
- False Positive	
- Sensitivity	
- Specificity	
- Hausdorff Distance	
- Mean Surface Distance $\pm$	std 
- Max Surface Distance	
- Average Symmetric Surface Distance (ASSD)
- MSD	
- Average root mean square surface distance (RMSD)
- Volumetric overlap error (VOE)
- Relative volume difference (VD)
